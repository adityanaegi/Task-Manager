## Q) How long did you spend on the coding test?
I spent approximately 20 hrs on the coding test. This included time for understanding the requirements, writing the code, and testing the application to ensure it met the specifications.

## Q) What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your     chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.
One of the most useful features added to the latest version of Python (Python 3.8) is the walrus operator (:=). It allows assignment expressions, enabling you to assign a value to a variable as part of an expression. This can make code more concise and readable.

#### Example:
```
# Example of the walrus operator in a while loop
data = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]

# Without the walrus operator
index = 0
while index < len(data):
    item = data[index]
    print(f"Processing {item}")
    index += 1

# With the walrus operator
index = 0
while (item := data[index]) is not None and index < len(data):
    print(f"Processing {item}")
    index += 1
```



## Q) How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

To track down a performance issue in production, I would follow these steps:

* Monitoring and Logging: Implement monitoring tools like New Relic, Datadog, or Prometheus to get real-time insights into the application's performance. 

* Profiling: Use profiling tools such as cProfile, Py-Spy, or other Python-specific profilers to identify bottlenecks in the code.

* Analyzing Metrics: Look at key performance metrics like response time, throughput, CPU usage, memory usage, etc.

* Code Review: Conduct a thorough code review focusing on the identified hotspots to optimize the code.

## Q) If you had more time, what additional features or improvements would you consider adding to the task management application?

If I had more time, I would consider adding the following features and improvements to the task management application :-

* User Authentication and Authorization: Implement user authentication to allow multiple users to manage their tasks securely. Add role-based access control to restrict certain features based on user roles.

* Notifications: Add email or push notifications to remind users of upcoming or overdue tasks.

* Analytics Dashboard: Provide users with an analytics dashboard to track their productivity, such as the number of tasks completed over time or the average time to complete a task.

* Search and Filter Enhancements: Improve the search and filter functionalities to allow more advanced query capabilities, such as searching by date range or priority.

These features would enhance the overall usability, functionality, and performance of the task management application, making it more robust and user-friendly.
